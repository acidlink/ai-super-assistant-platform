# IT Support Systems 2025: Ticketing, Monitoring, Network Diagnostics, Automation, Assets, and Portals

## Executive Summary

Modern IT support has converged around three pillars: a single system of record for requests and services, pervasive observability across infrastructure and networks, and AI-driven automation that makes both pillars faster and more reliable. The market leaders—ServiceNow for enterprise IT Service Management (ITSM), Zendesk and Freshdesk for AI-powered service desks, and Zabbix, Nagios, PRTG, and the Prometheus-Grafana stack for monitoring—now offer mature capabilities to ingest events, route work, enrich context, and act autonomously, often across hybrid and multi-cloud estates. Zabbix emphasizes enterprise-grade, open-source observability with flexible deployment (on-premises, cloud, or managed) and a low total cost of ownership. ServiceNow integrates AI agents and workflow automation with IT Asset Management and a robust integration ecosystem. Zendesk and Freshdesk deliver strong omnichannel ticket orchestration with built-in AI, self-service portals, and analytics. Jira Service Management (JSM) anchors cross-team collaboration with request queues, SLAs, and automation tied to Atlassian workflows. Together, these platforms enable end-to-end automation from detection to resolution, while maintaining governance and visibility through asset and configuration data.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

Top takeaways:
- AI is no longer optional. It underpins agent productivity, ticket deflection, proactive incident prevention, and self-service across channels. ServiceNow’s AI agents and Control Tower, Zendesk’s Copilot and AI agents, and Freshdesk’s Freddy AI agents (including email auto-resolution) are becoming table stakes for enterprises aiming to reduce mean time to resolve (MTTR) and boost deflection.[^1][^2][^3]
- CMDB maturity drives safer automation. When automated discovery, normalized data, and impact analysis are in place, teams can safely auto-remediate, approve changes, and prevent outages. Platforms like ServiceNow, BMC Helix, and Freshservice, as well as specialist tools (e.g., Device42), raise the fidelity of decisions that automation makes.[^12]
- Deployment flexibility matters. Zabbix’s on-premises and fully managed cloud options, PRTG’s Windows-based on-premises control, and Prometheus-Grafana’s open, composable stack allow organizations to align monitoring topologies with data residency, cost, and skill constraints.[^5][^6][^7][^16]
- Security and governance are differentiators. Enterprise trust features (e.g., Zendesk Trust Center, role-based controls, SSO/2FA, audit trails) are vital for client portals and AI adoption in regulated environments.[^4][^13]

Recommendations snapshot by organization profile:
- SMB: Favor tools that combine ease-of-use, automation, and predictable licensing. PRTG provides a single-pane-of-glass network monitor with transparent pricing. Zendesk and Freshdesk deliver fast time-to-value for service desks, with AI-assisted routing and self-service. JSM is a strong fit if already in the Atlassian ecosystem.[^2][^3][^4][^11][^16]
- Mid-market: Choose balanced platforms that scale and integrate. Zabbix balances cost and enterprise features; Freshdesk’s Freddy AI can accelerate deflection; JSM’s request queues and SLAs scale well across teams; PRTG covers network diagnostics comprehensively; Grafana+Prometheus adds flexible network monitoring with SNMP.[^2][^5][^11][^12][^16]
- Enterprise: Prioritize breadth, governance, and AI maturity. ServiceNow offers depth across ITSM, ITAM, and AI with strong integration options; Zabbix supports large-scale, low TCO monitoring; Nagios (Core/CSP/XI) provides a wide plugin ecosystem and enterprise packaging; Zendesk scales support operations with enterprise trust features.[^1][^4][^5][^6][^7][^17]

Zabbix stands out in enterprise monitoring for open-source flexibility, security posture (including NIS2 compliance support), predictable support pricing, and deployment choice (on-prem, cloud, or third-party). ServiceNow is the most comprehensive enterprise ITSM platform for organizations prioritizing integrated ITAM/CMDB, workflow automation, and governance at scale.[^5][^1]

## Methodology and Scope

This report analyzes ticketing and ITSM platforms (ServiceNow, Zendesk, Freshdesk, Jira Service Management), monitoring and observability tools (Zabbix, Nagios, PRTG, Prometheus-Grafana), network diagnostics capabilities, automated troubleshooting workflows, CMDB/asset management, client portals, deployment models (cloud, on-premises, hybrid), pricing/licensing, and integration ecosystems. It synthesizes vendor websites, product documentation, vendor blogs, and case studies available as of October 28, 2025.

Limitations include incomplete official pricing for some enterprise platforms (e.g., ServiceNow, BMC, Device42) and anecdotal market commentary on pricing changes (e.g., PRTG Reddit post) that may require verification. Formal security certifications beyond vendor statements (e.g., ServiceNow, Zabbix Cloud) are not enumerated here and should be validated during procurement.[^5][^6][^13]

## The Modern IT Support Stack: Concepts and Architecture

An end-to-end support architecture spans seven layers: ticketing/ITSM, observability and monitoring, network diagnostics, automation/AI, CMDB/asset management, client portals, and integration/webhooks. In practice, the flow is circular: monitoring detects anomalies; events enter ticketing; automation suggests or takes action informed by CMDB context; portals and knowledge base enable self-service; integration fabric keeps data in sync; and governance closes the loop with analytics and SLAs.

To illustrate the relationships, Table 1 maps the stack layers to the primary tools covered in this report. The intent is not to prescribe a single combination but to show how the layers interlock to move from detection to resolution with minimal friction.

Table 1. Conceptual mapping of the IT support stack layers to representative tools

| Stack Layer                         | Representative Tools                                                                                 | Role in the Stack                                                                                 |

Ticketing/ITSM systems unify work items (incidents, requests, problems, changes) in a single place, enforce SLAs, and provide knowledge and context for agents. Observability platforms provide the signals that trigger tickets and measure the outcomes of automation. Network diagnostics tools bring clarity to performance bottlenecks and availability issues at the fabric layer. Automation layers transform repetitive, error-prone tasks into reliable workflows—augmenting human agents and, in some cases, resolving issues without human intervention. CMDB and asset management tools provide the structural context (what depends on what) that allows automation to be safe. Client portals and knowledge bases close the loop by enabling self-service and deflection, and the integration fabric stitches everything together so that data flows across systems without manual effort.[^1][^4][^5][^6][^7][^12][^13][^14]

## Ticketing and ITSM Platforms: Capabilities and Differences

Across platforms, we evaluate AI/automation, workflow governance, omnichannel support, knowledge/portal depth, analytics/reporting, integrations/APIs, and deployment choices. Enterprise buyers should prioritize the degree to which automation and AI can be trusted to act safely with CMDB-backed context, and how easily the platform integrates with existing monitoring and collaboration tools.

Table 2 synthesizes key features. It highlights where platforms differentiate and where procurement should expect trade-offs—for example, between ease-of-use and deep governance, or between packaged AI and extensibility.

Zabbix is a strong fit for enterprises seeking open-source observability with enterprise features and predictable support costs, while retaining deployment flexibility. Nagios offers a proven open-source core with a rich plugin ecosystem and a pathway to enterprise packaging (CSP) or commercial XI. PRTG’s strength is its single-pane-of-glass view, sensor catalog, and transparent pricing, especially for network-heavy environments. Prometheus and Grafana offer composable, open-source monitoring and visualization with advanced SNMP workflows for network diagnostics.[^5][^6][^7][^16]

### Zabbix

Zabbix is an enterprise-class, open-source observability solution for IT and OT. It supports on-premises deployments, a fully managed SaaS (Zabbix Cloud), and third-party cloud environments. The platform is designed for scalability and security, with NIS2 compliance support, and offers a global partner network. Zabbix emphasizes low total cost of ownership with no per-device fees and predictable support pricing. Case studies demonstrate real-world deployment at scale and specialized monitoring (e.g., logs at SEB Bank, Columbus lab at the European Space Agency).[^5][^8][^9][^10]

### Nagios (Core/CSP/XI)

Nagios provides free, powerful open-source monitoring for servers, networks, applications, and services, with over 5,000 community add-ons and 25+ years of production use. The Nagios Core Services Platform (CSP) packages enterprise features on top of the free core, including wizards, dashboards, and a preconfigured VM, while Mod-Gearman enhances scalability. The ecosystem supports NCPA (cross-platform agent), extensive plugins, and visualization addons. Enterprises can also consider Nagios XI for commercial features and support.[^6][^14][^15][^16][^17]

### PRTG Network Monitor

PRTG is a Windows-based, on-premises network monitor with an all-in-one approach. It uses a “sensor” model (one measured value per sensor), supports automatic discovery, offers custom maps/dashboards, and provides distributed monitoring across remote locations. Licensing tiers scale by the number of sensors with a transparent, annual subscription model and a 30-day full trial. PRTG is vendor-agnostic and supports monitoring of IT, OT, and IoT devices and services.[^16]

### Prometheus + Grafana for Network Monitoring

Prometheus and Grafana deliver advanced network monitoring via SNMP using the snmp_exporter and a generator that parses MIBs to create configurations. Prometheus scrapes metrics exposed by the exporter; Grafana visualizes and alerts on these signals. The stack integrates with a wide range of data sources and supports SLO management, anomaly detection, and contextual root cause analysis. Organizations can adopt open-source self-hosting or managed offerings with defined quotas and plugins.[^7]

## Network Diagnostics and Performance

Network diagnostics require three capabilities: broad device coverage (SNMP/MIB support, vendor-specific OIDs), deep visibility (interfaces, CPU/memory, errors, latency, topology), and actionable alerting (thresholds, anomaly detection, correlation). Diagnostics also need to align with the wider incident lifecycle to avoid noise and accelerate root cause analysis.

Table 4 compares network diagnostics capabilities across the four monitoring stacks.

Table 4. Network diagnostics feature matrix

| Capability                      | Zabbix                          | Nagios                          | PRTG                               | Prometheus + Grafana                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| SNMP versions                   | Broad support (typical)         | Plugins for SNMP; NCPA for agents| SNMP sensors and templates          | snmp_exporter supports v2c; v3 recommended     |
| MIB support                     | Broad (typical)                 | Plugin-driven                    | Vendor templates and MIB handling    | Generator uses MIBs to build snmp.yml          |
| Interface/traffic monitoring    | Native templates and discovery  | Plugins (e.g., check_* utilities)| Sensor per port; auto-discovery     | dashboards from Prometheus metrics             |
| Bandwidth utilization/throughput| Native metrics and graphs        | Plugins; visualization addons    | Bandwidth sensors; custom maps       | Graphs/alerts in Grafana; custom dashboards    |
| Latency and error counters      | Native checks and triggers       | Plugin-based checks              | Sensor catalog for ping/error        | Prometheus queries and Grafana alerts          |
| Auto-discovery                   | Supported                       | Scripts/wizards                  | Automatic network discovery         | Generator + targets; manual or scripted        |
| Custom dashboards               | Native                           | Addons                           | Custom maps and dashboards           | Grafana dashboards from any data source        |
| Anomaly detection               | Platform-level capabilities      | Plugin or integrations           | AI anomaly detection feature         | Alerting and AI-powered observability in Cloud |

Zabbix and PRTG offer native, template-driven SNMP monitoring and visual dashboards. Nagios’ strength is its plugin ecosystem, which covers SNMP and many vendor-specific checks. Prometheus-Grafana’s SNMP path is composable: MIB-to-configuration generation with the snmp_exporter generator, Prometheus scraping, and Grafana dashboards and alerts.[^5][^6][^7][^16][^15]

### SNMP/MIB Workflow (Prometheus-Grafana)

The Prometheus SNMP workflow follows a clear sequence: collect device MIBs, run snmpwalk to select OIDs, translate OIDs back to MIB names, configure the generator to produce snmp.yml, run the snmp_exporter, and add targets to Prometheus for scraping. Version v2c is commonly used for convenience, while v3 is recommended for stronger security. From there, Grafana visualizes metrics and configures alerts. This workflow provides full control and transparency for custom network diagnostics.[^7]

## Automated Troubleshooting and AI Workflows

AI automation in IT support spans four high-impact use cases: auto-resolution across channels, intelligent routing and escalation, self-service that deflects tickets, and knowledge acceleration (finding and generating the right guidance). The best outcomes occur when AI is grounded in accurate, up-to-date CMDB and knowledge base context.

Table 5 summarizes automation capabilities across ticketing and monitoring platforms.

Table 5. Automation capabilities by platform

| Platform              | AI Agents / Copilot                                | Auto-Resolution                         | Routing & Escalation                                   | Self-Service & Chatbots                           | Knowledge Tools                                   | Workflow Generation / Extensibility                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ServiceNow            | AI agents; AI Control Tower; Now Assist             | Proactive incident prevention            | Workflow-driven; process mining; decision support       | Generative self-service                           | Knowledge integrated with workflows               | App Engine; Integration Hub; Store apps                  |
| Zendesk               | AI agents; Copilot                                  | AI-driven workflow automations           | Omnichannel routing; skills-/intent-based routing       | Help Center; AI-powered knowledge                 | Knowledge base with generative AI                  | Prebuilt/custom workflows; APIs; marketplace              |
| Freshdesk/Freshservice| Freddy AI (email/conversational); AI Copilot        | Email ticket auto-resolution             | Automated routing and prioritization                   | Branded help center; community                    | AI agents surface related incidents                | Advanced workflows; native integrations                   |
| Jira Service Management| Automation rules                                    | N/A (rule-driven automation)             | SLA-driven escalations; cross-project rules             | Self-service portal; knowledge base               | Knowledge base                                     | Rules across projects; Slack/Teams integrations           |

Freshworks describes AI agents that read, understand, and resolve email tickets and handle conversational flows end-to-end. Workativ articulates the broader automation strategies and outcomes: faster MTTR, higher SLA adherence, improved first-call resolution, and deflection of common tasks such as password resets. Workativ’s approach also highlights generative AI, NLP-driven diagnosis, and self-service inside collaboration channels like Slack and Microsoft Teams.[^2][^3][^18]

### Use Cases and ROI Patterns

- Password resets and account unlocks can account for a significant share of IT calls; automating these flows reduces volume and speeds resolution, improving employee experience and cost efficiency.[^18]
- Generative AI and NLP improve incident classification and routing, surfacing the right knowledge and actions earlier in the lifecycle, thereby decreasing handle time and boosting first-contact resolution.[^18][^3]
- Monitoring-triggered automation reduces MTTR by closing the gap between detection and remediation. For example, auto-creating tickets with enriched context and executing runbooks based on severity and impacted services raises consistency and compliance.[^1][^4]

Implementation best practices: start with narrow, high-volume workflows; ensure data quality and CMDB alignment; manage change deliberately; instrument analytics; and iterate continuously based on measured deflection, MTTR, SLA adherence, and agent productivity.[^18]

## CMDB and IT Asset Management

A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) acts as a structural memory for IT: it stores configuration items (CIs), their relationships, and dependencies. The most valuable capabilities are automated discovery and relationship mapping, data normalization (to keep records accurate), and impact analysis (to plan changes safely and resolve incidents faster). AI and automation increasingly support these tasks by detecting duplicates, filling missing fields, and predicting impact.

Table 6 compares CMDB/ITAM capabilities across representative platforms.

Best practices include regular reconciliation, data quality metrics, scheduled discovery cadences, clear ownership, automation of updates, and cross-team training. Common pitfalls—out-of-date data, governance gaps, integration issues, and duplication—are best mitigated by choosing tools with proven integrations and focusing adoption on workflows that make the CMDB “live” (e.g., change approvals that depend on it).[^12]

## Client Portals and Self-Service

Client portals are a critical engagement layer. They offer secure access to knowledge bases, ticket submission and tracking, community forums, and account management. For enterprise use, portals must support strong security (SSO, 2FA, encryption, audit trails), multi-language and multi-brand configurations, and workflow automation.

Table 7 summarizes portal capabilities for leading platforms.

Table 7. Portal capabilities

| Platform              | Knowledge Base & Search                            | Channels & Community                            | Security & Access Controls                                  | Localization & Branding                          | Analytics & Workflow Automation                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Zendesk               | AI-powered knowledge; generative search and authoring| Help Center; community forums; omnichannel       | 2FA; encryption; granular permissions; SSO; IP restrictions; audit trails | Multi-language; multi-brand; no-code customization | Built-in analytics; customizable workflows      |
| Jira Service Management| Knowledge base integrated with service desk         | Self-service portal; queues                      | Role-based access (Jira)                                     | Customizable for teams                           | Reports and dashboards                           |
| Freshdesk             | Knowledge base; Freddy AI agents leverage knowledge | Omnichannel; community                           | Role-based controls (platform-standard)                      | Branded help center                              | Analytics and insights                           |

Zendesk’s Help Center emphasizes AI-enhanced knowledge creation and security controls suitable for regulated environments. JSM and Freshdesk both offer self-service portals with knowledge integration, though Zendesk’s documented feature set is particularly extensive with respect to security, auditability, and multi-brand localization.[^13][^11][^3]

### Security and Compliance Features

Security must be a first-class requirement for client portals. Zendesk provides enterprise-class protections including two-factor authentication, encryption for data and email, granular access controls, single sign-on, IP-based restrictions, and audit trails. These features enable teams to segment access by document or role, maintain compliance logging, and provide secure self-service at scale.[^13]

## Deployment Models: Cloud, On-Premises, Hybrid

Deployment choices reflect priorities across cost, control, compliance, scalability, and maintenance. Cloud/SaaS offers speed and lower upfront costs; on-premises offers maximum control over data and configuration; hybrid allows teams to keep sensitive components local while leveraging managed services for elasticity.

Table 8 outlines deployment options and pros/cons.

Table 8. Deployment options and considerations

| Platform/Stack         | Cloud/SaaS Options                          | On-Premises Options                         | Hybrid Viability                                  | Compliance Considerations                                 | Scaling & Maintenance                               |

| PRTG                   | N/A (Windows server-based)                   | Windows server                                | Strong (local core + remote probes)               | On-prem control over data and config                      | Distributed monitoring; transparent licensing       |
| Prometheus + Grafana   | Managed Grafana Cloud                        | Self-hosted Prometheus/Grafana                | Strong (mix managed and self-hosted)              | Data residency via chosen deployment                      | Mimir/Tempo/Loki scale metrics/logs/traces          |

Zabbix’s flexibility (on-prem, cloud, third-party cloud) and PRTG’s on-prem control model are aligned with data residency and customization needs. Managed Prometheus/Grafana accelerates time-to-value and standardizes operations, while self-hosted deployments retain full control. Buyers should evaluate cost of ownership over three years, not just license fees, and factor in the operational overhead of maintenance and upgrades.[^5][^6][^7][^16]

## Integration Ecosystems and APIs

Integration patterns fall into two broad categories: APIs and webhooks. APIs allow flexible, query-driven interactions; webhooks deliver event-driven triggers that push data when something happens. In modern ITSM, these patterns bi-directionally sync monitoring alerts, CMDB changes, ticketing updates, and chat-based requests.

ServiceNow’s Integration Hub and Store provide ready-made connectors and certified applications. Zendesk offers built-in integrations, a large marketplace, and APIs for building custom integrations. JSM integrates natively with Slack and Microsoft Teams, enabling conversational ticketing and two-way synchronization. Prometheus and Grafana expose endpoints used to scrape SNMP metrics and drive dashboards and alerts.[^1][^4][^7][^11][^14]

Table 9 summarizes integration capabilities.

## Pricing and Licensing Overview

Public pricing varies widely. Enterprise platforms (e.g., ServiceNow, BMC Helix, Device42) typically require sales engagement. Monitoring tools provide clearer public models, and SaaS ticketing platforms often publish agent-based pricing.

Table 10 provides a public pricing snapshot where available.

Table 10. Public pricing snapshot (where available)

| Platform/Tool                   | Model (public)                                     | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

Where official pricing is not public, engage procurement to model TCO over three years, including support, integration, training, and maintenance. Anecdotal market commentary on PRTG price changes exists in community channels and should be verified with the vendor for accuracy and current terms.[^12][^13][^16]

## Security, Compliance, and Governance

Security posture, compliance, and auditability are central to platform selection. Portals must enforce strong authentication and access controls; ITSM platforms must document governance and provide visibility into data handling; and monitoring stacks must support secure protocols and data residency preferences.

Zabbix emphasizes security by design and supports compliance frameworks such as NIS2, with a focus on reliability and scalability. Zendesk’s Trust Center and client portal security features (2FA, encryption, granular permissions, SSO, IP restrictions, audit trails) provide a model for secure self-service at scale.[^5][^13]

Table 11 summarizes security features.

Table 11. Security feature matrix

| Platform/Feature          | Authentication & Access                    | Encryption & Data Protection                 | Audit Trails & Compliance                   |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Zendesk Portals           | 2FA; SSO; granular permissions; IP rules   | Data and email encryption                     | Audit trails; Trust Center                   |
| Zabbix (platform)         | Security by design; enterprise posture     | Secure architecture; compliance support       | NIS2 compliance support (vendor statement)   |
| ServiceNow (platform)     | Enterprise governance; role-based access   | Enterprise-class security (platform-level)    | Platform governance and reporting            |
| Jira Service Management   | Role-based access (Jira)                   | Platform-level protections                    | Built-in reports and dashboards              |

Enterprise buyers should request detailed security documentation (e.g., SOC reports, data residency options, DPA templates) during evaluation, in addition to verifying certifications and compliance mappings relevant to their jurisdictions.[^1][^5][^13]

## Reference Architectures and Implementation Patterns

Pattern A: Enterprise ITSM + Open-Source Monitoring + CMDB
- Components: ServiceNow (ITSM/ITAM/CMDB), Zabbix (or Nagios) for observability, Grafana dashboards for executive visibility, Prometheus SNMP for network devices where needed.
- Data flows: Zabbix/Nagios events create tickets in ServiceNow; CMDB impact analysis informs change risk and自动化 decisions; ServiceNow workflows trigger remediation; Grafana visualizes service health.
- When to use: Regulated industries, global enterprises, high change cadence with heavy governance needs.[^1][^5][^7]

Pattern B: SaaS Service Desk + Network Diagnostics + AI Self-Service
- Components: Zendesk or Freshdesk; PRTG for network monitoring; Prometheus-Grafana for advanced SNMP; AI agents for deflection; JSM where Atlassian collaboration is strategic.
- Data flows: PRTG and SNMP alerts escalate to service desk; AI agents resolve common issues; Help Center knowledge improves deflection; Slack/Teams integrations handle conversational ticketing.
- When to use: SMBs and mid-market teams seeking rapid time-to-value with strong self-service and network diagnostics.[^2][^3][^4][^11][^16]

Table 12 provides a bill of materials and configuration checklist for each pattern.

Table 12. Bill of materials (BOM) and configuration checklist

| Pattern                         | Components                                  | Key Configuration Steps                                                      |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A: Enterprise ITSM + Open Source| ServiceNow; Zabbix/Nagios; Grafana; Prometheus SNMP | Connect monitoring to ITSM via integration hub/APIs; map CIs; define workflows; SNMP generator configs; SLOs and dashboards |
| B: SaaS Desk + Network          | Zendesk or Freshdesk; PRTG; Prometheus-Grafana; (optional JSM) | Configure channels and AI routing; set PRTG sensors; build Grafana SNMP dashboards; implement self-service portal and knowledge articles |

Change management, governance, and data quality guardrails:
- Establish data ownership and reconciliation cadences for the CMDB; instrument data quality KPIs.
- Define automation guardrails (e.g., which runbooks can auto-execute under what CI states).
- Pilot in a single domain; expand iteratively; capture baseline metrics and improvements.
- Train agents and engineers on new workflows; maintain knowledge articles with AI-assisted authoring where supported.[^1][^3][^7][^12][^13]

## Risks, Limitations, and Decision Criteria

Common pitfalls:
- CMDB data staleness undermines automation safety and decision-making.
- Incomplete asset ownership and inconsistent normalization lead to unreliable impact analysis.
- Weak integration governance produces fragile flows and duplicate data.
- Over-customization without a clear governance model increases maintenance burden.

Decision criteria:
- Scale and complexity: Enterprise governance and integrated ITAM/CMDB vs. lightweight service desk needs.
- Compliance and data residency: On-prem control vs. cloud convenience.
- Automation depth: Availability of AI agents, workflow generation, and CMDB-grounded actions.
- Total cost of ownership: License, support, integration, training, and operations over 3 years.

Table 13 provides a decision matrix to align priorities with platform choices.

Organizations should weigh these criteria against their strategic objectives, regulatory environment, and internal skills. For many, a hybrid approach—combining a SaaS service desk with open-source monitoring and selective managed observability—delivers the best balance of agility, control, and cost.[^5][^6][^12][^16]
