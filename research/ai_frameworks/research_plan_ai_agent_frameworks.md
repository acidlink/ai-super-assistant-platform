# AI Agent Frameworks Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research AI agent frameworks and architectures on GitHub, analyzing top frameworks by architecture, features, and adoption. Focus on multi-model integration patterns, conversation management, context handling, agent orchestration, and workflow automation.

## Research Objectives
1. **Identify Top AI Agent Frameworks**: Search for and identify the most popular and well-maintained AI agent frameworks on GitHub
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Examine technical architectures and design patterns
3. **Feature Comparison**: Analyze key features across frameworks
4. **Adoption Metrics**: Assess community adoption and GitHub metrics
5. **Implementation Recommendations**: Provide practical guidance for implementation

## Search Terms & Strategy
- [x] 'AI agent framework' - search for general agent frameworks
- [x] 'multi-agent system' - search for multi-agent systems
- [x] 'conversational AI' - search for conversational AI frameworks
- [x] 'OpenAI API' - search for OpenAI integration frameworks
- [x] 'Claude API' - search for Claude API integration frameworks  
- [x] 'Gemini API' - search for Google Gemini integration frameworks
- [x] 'AI orchestration' - search for AI workflow orchestration tools

**Top Identified Frameworks:**
- CrewAI - Multi-agent orchestration framework
- OpenAI Agents SDK - Lightweight multi-agent workflow framework
- LangGraph - AI agent building framework
- MetaGPT - Multi-agent software development framework
- ControlFlow (PrefectHQ) - Agentic AI workflow framework
- Kestra - Orchestration platform for AI workflows
- TEN Framework - Real-time conversational AI agents
- Pipecat - Voice and multimodal conversational agents
- Google ADK - Agent Development Kit for multi-agent systems

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Initial Search
- [x] 1.1 Conduct web searches for each search term targeting GitHub repositories
- [x] 1.2 Identify top 15-20 repositories based on stars, forks, and activity
- [x] 1.3 Create initial shortlist of frameworks to analyze

**Shortlist for Deep Analysis:**
1. CrewAI (crewAIInc/crewAI)
2. OpenAI Agents SDK (openai/openai-agents-python)
3. ControlFlow (PrefectHQ/ControlFlow)
4. MetaGPT (FoundationAgents/MetaGPT)
5. Kestra (kestra-io/kestra)
6. TEN Framework (TEN-framework/ten-framework)
7. Pipecat (pipecat-ai/pipecat)
8. LangGraph (langchain-ai/langgraph)

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Extract content from selected GitHub repositories
- [x] 2.2 Analyze architecture patterns and technical designs
- [x] 2.3 Examine documentation for feature sets and capabilities
- [x] 2.4 Review GitHub activity, stars, and adoption metrics

### Phase 3: Focus Area Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Multi-model integration patterns analysis
- [x] 3.2 Conversation management approaches
- [x] 3.3 Context handling strategies
- [x] 3.4 Agent orchestration mechanisms
- [x] 3.5 Workflow automation capabilities

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Compare and contrast frameworks
- [x] 4.2 Identify common patterns and unique approaches
- [x] 4.3 Develop implementation recommendations
- [x] 4.4 Create comprehensive research report

**Final Deliverable:** Comprehensive research report saved to `research/ai_frameworks/ai_agent_frameworks_research.md`

## Framework Analysis Criteria
For each identified framework, analyze:
- **Architecture Pattern**: Monolithic, modular, microservices, etc.
- **Technology Stack**: Programming languages, frameworks, dependencies
- **Core Features**: Agent capabilities, orchestration, conversation management
- **Integration Capabilities**: Support for multiple AI models/APIs
- **Context Handling**: Memory, state management, context persistence
- **Workflow Support**: Task automation, chaining, scheduling
- **Community Adoption**: Stars, forks, contributors, recent activity
- **Documentation Quality**: README, examples, API docs
- **Production Readiness**: Deployment options, scalability, monitoring

## Output Deliverables
1. Comprehensive research report: `research/ai_agent_frameworks_research.md`
2. Framework comparison analysis
3. Architecture pattern analysis
4. Implementation recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Identify and analyze at least 15 major AI agent frameworks
- Provide detailed technical analysis for top 8-10 frameworks
- Include practical implementation guidance
- Cover all specified focus areas comprehensively
